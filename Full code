All right summary of the data set objects:
**full_merged** is the total world data with income levels, developing state and SDG scores for their respective countries

**african**, **american**, **asian**, **european** and **oceanian** divides the countries into their respective continents as listed on the *country_codes.csv* file

**high_income**, **upper_mid**, **lower_mid**, **low_income** and **NA_income** divides the countries into their respective income levels as listed on the *sdr_fd5e4b5a.csv* or *goal_file* 
[Note: NA income means that the income level of that country is not listed]

*Stuff still needed*
1: NA values found in SDG index scores
2: NA values found in income levels
3: Understand what Percentage missing values mean

*What to do next:*
1: Decide how to filter the NA values

**Q1 Methods**
For our hypothesis test, we will simulate a sampling distribution of the average SDG score when taking a random sample of 3 countries. Then we will take a random sample of 3 countries from a continent and see if the average is deviant from the sampling distribution. We will conduct this test for each continent separately (so let's say we're testing for Africa, we'll pick 3 countries from Africa (without replacement) and take its mean sdg score as the average, then that average will be our test statistic which we will use to compare with the simulation).

The reason we picked 3 countries is because Oceania only has 4 valid countries in the data set, it also requires less computing power to pick less countries. It also reduces the chance of sampling an outlier SDG score giving us a faulty representative for the continents.

Alpha level = 0.05 or 5%
H0: mean SDG score of 3 random countries from a continent = mean SDG score of 3 random countries of world
H1: mean SDG score of 3 random countries from a continent != mean SDG score of 3 random countries of world
```{r}
set.seed(21374)
## Plotting the distribution of the SDG scores of countries
## ggplot(data=full_merged, aes(x=index_score)) + geom_histogram(fill="red",color="black") + labs(title= "Real SDG Index score distribution", x="SDG Index score") + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(35,100))


## Creating the sampling distribution of selecting 3 countries and calculating their mean
n_trials = 1000 # number of samples in the distribution
n_sample = 3 # number of countries chosen in random sample

# simulating
fhat_sdg_simulations <- rep(NA, n_trials)
for (i in 1:n_trials){average <- mean(sample(full_merged$index_score, n_sample ,replace=FALSE))
fhat_sdg_simulations[i] <- average}


hist(fhat_sdg_simulations, main = "Simulated mean of SDG Index score of 3 random countries distribution", 30) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,100))

## Calculating p values for each of the continents
# getting our test statistics and normal distribution median
f0_sim <- median(fhat_sdg_simulations)
ts_asia <- mean(sample(asian$index_score, n_sample,replace=FALSE))
ts_africa <- mean(sample(african$index_score, n_sample,replace=FALSE))
ts_america <- mean(sample(american$index_score, n_sample,replace=FALSE))
ts_europe <- mean(sample(european$index_score, n_sample,replace=FALSE))
ts_oceania <- mean(sample(oceanian$index_score, n_sample,replace=FALSE))

# getting our p values for each continent
typicals <- 0
for (i in 1:n_trials){
  if (abs(ts_asia - f0_sim) <= abs(fhat_sdg_simulations[i] - f0_sim)) {typicals = typicals + 1}
}
p_value_asia <- typicals/n_trials

typicals <- 0
for (i in 1:n_trials){
  if (abs(ts_africa - f0_sim) <= abs(fhat_sdg_simulations[i] - f0_sim)) {typicals = typicals + 1}
}
p_value_africa <- typicals/n_trials

typicals <- 0
for (i in 1:n_trials){
  if (abs(ts_america - f0_sim) <= abs(fhat_sdg_simulations[i] - f0_sim)) {typicals = typicals + 1}
}
p_value_america <- typicals/n_trials

typicals <- 0
for (i in 1:n_trials){
  if (abs(ts_europe - f0_sim) <= abs(fhat_sdg_simulations[i] - f0_sim)) {typicals = typicals + 1}
}
p_value_europe <- typicals/n_trials

typicals <- 0
for (i in 1:n_trials){
  if (abs(ts_oceania - f0_sim) <= abs(fhat_sdg_simulations[i] - f0_sim)) {typicals = typicals + 1}
}
p_value_oceania <- typicals/n_trials
```
The P-values from our test are as follows:
P_Value_Africa = 0.083
P_Value_America= 0.311
P_Value_Asia = 0.904
P_Value_Europe = 0.035
P_Value_Oceania = 0.986


So from this, we conclude that the average SDG score from Europe, if we select 3 random countries, is going to be considerably deviant/more extreme compared to if we took the average countries from the world (counting countries with valid income and SDG scores in the dataset).

If we had set our alpha level to be higher (10% for example), we'd also conclude that Africa would have a considerably deviant/more extreme mean SDG score compared to the world's mean SDG score from sampling 3 random countries from each.

From our test statistic, we can also infer that Europe will have a higher than the world average SDG score as well as their average SDG score is higher. 

If we had to guess, this is probably due to Europe having an abnormally large portion of high income countries compared to other continents, which is correlated to higher SDG scores, which we illustrate in the scatterplot and bar charts.


For our second method, we'll build a classification tree to illustrate how we distinguish the differences between continents and their income group and index score. We won't be splitting our data into training or testing groups to combat overfitting as we won't be using this tree to predict where "new" countries would be placed given their SDG score and Income group as new countries popping up is not very likely to happen. We want our model to be as fit as possible for this specific (full_merged) data as it is the only one we are working with.

We'll also build simpler trees using income group and index scores to give a further analysis between the relationships between SDG scores, income groups and continents.
```{r}
#classification tree
tree_model_2 <- rpart(continent ~ income_group + index_score, (data = full_merged))
plot(as.party(tree_model_2),gp=gpar(cex=0.6),type="simple", method="class")

summary(tree_model_2)$'Variable importance'
```
We can see that our model is a little bit complicated, but the important thing to note is that the error rate is about 28% (calculated), the variable importance is 64% for index_score and 36% for  income_group (from summary).

What this means is that our model can guess the right continent of a country given the index score and income group about 72% of the time. Since guessing a country's continent randomly correctly should be 1/5 (20%), this implies that SDG score and income groups are correlated to/associated with being from certain continents.

The variable importance implies that the SDG score is more strongly correlated with countries being from a certain continent compared to income groups, although this is most likely due to income groups being classified into very few (only 4) discrete categories while SDG scores are continuous and higher ranging.

Our tree also does not have a node for Oceania, so that means the model will always guess wrong for a Oceanic country. This is because Oceanic countries are underrepresented in the data set, only having 4 entries whereas the other continents have at least 25.

```{r}
# Code for the simpler trees
tree_model_1 <- rpart(continent ~ index_score, (data = full_merged))
plot(as.party(tree_model_1),gp=gpar(cex=0.9),type="simple")

tree_model_3 <- rpart(continent ~ income_group, (data = full_merged))
plot(as.party(tree_model_3),gp=gpar(cex=0.6),type="simple", method="class")
```
[Note: These analysis are based on our lm tree model]
Now from our simpler SDG tree, we can see that: 
Europe is associated with "high" SDG index scores above or equal to 75.25.
Asia is associated with "middle" SDG index scores between 62.8-75.24.
Africa is associated with "lower" SDG index scores below 62.8.

For the income tree, we can see that: 
Europe is associated with High income countries.
The Americas are associated with Upper middle income countries.
Africa is associated with Lower middle and low income countries.

From our original more complicated model, here is the full association analysis/prediction strategy (which will be accurate 78% of the time given the data set).

Guess:
Europe if:
- SDG index score is above/equal to 75.25

Africa if: 
- SDG index score is below 62.8
- Income group is upper middle and SDG index score is below 68.1 

Asia if:
- Income group is either high or lower middle and SDG index score is between 62.8 and 75.25 
- Income group is upper middle and SDG index score is above 70.85 and below 73.55

Americas if:
- Income group is upper middle and SDG index score is above/equal to 68.1 and below 70.85 
- Income group is upper middle and SDG index score is above/equal to 73.55 and below 75.25

Note: There are no high income countries with SDG scores below 63
      There are no low income countries with SDG scores above 60.2
      Hence no nodes correspond to these specific cases.

head(bar_proportions)
```
From these plots, we can see that Europe has a high amount of high income countries (nearly 75%) and no low income countries while Africa has nearly the opposite, a high proportion of low income countries and no high income countries.

While the other three continents have relatively more even spreads of income levels.
```{r}
full_merged |> ggplot(aes(y=index_score, x=income_score))+geom_point()+ facet_wrap(~continent) +geom_smooth(method ="lm", se=FALSE) + labs(title= 'Divided into continents', y= "Index Score", x = "Income Score")

full_merged |> ggplot(aes(y=index_score, x=income_score, color = continent))+ geom_point() +geom_smooth(method ="lm", se=FALSE) + labs(title= 'SDG score compared to Income levels', y = "SDG index score", x = "Income score")

lm_tree1 <- lm(income_score ~ index_score, data = full_merged)
summary(lm_tree1)$r.squared
```
From this, we can see that for all continents, a higher income score/income level is correlated with a higher SDG index score. A single best fit line for the entire data set (comparing income score with index score) would have an R^2 value of 0.653 which implies some correlation between the two variables.
```{r}
## Scatter plot for continent as a point
continent_averages |> ggplot(aes(y=average_index_score, x=average_income_score, color = continent)) + geom_point() + labs(title= 'Average index and income scores for continents', y = "Average Index Score", x = "Average Income Score") + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(35, 90))


```
This graph shows where the continents would place if we took their averages.
We can still see a positive correlation between income score and index score.

In summary, income score seems to have a positive correlation with SDG score.
Europe has a high proportion of higher income countries and high SDG index scores on average (high 70s).
America, Asia and Oceania are more varied but average out to be about upper middle income and middle index score (high 60s,low 70s).
Africa has a high proportion of low and lower middle income countries and low SDG index scores on average (high 50s).

Analysis：

Based on the counts:
Cluster 1: Asia and Europe are the top two continents, with 19 and 15 countries, respectively. This cluster suggests
 a diverse group of countries from both Asia and Europe that share similar SDG progress and income levels. The relatively 
high count for both continents indicates a mix of possibly developing and emerging economies in Asia alongside several
 European countries that may share economic or developmental similarities with these Asian countries.

Cluster 2: Africa leads this cluster with 12 countries, followed closely by Asia with 11. The closeness in the count
 suggests a balanced representation between African and Asian nations within this cluster. Countries in this cluster
 are likely to have moderate SDG progress rates and income levels, and the presence of both continents indicates similar
 challenges or developmental stages despite geographic diversity.

Cluster 3: Dominated by Europe with 22 countries, and followed by Asia with a significantly smaller representation of 5
 countries, this cluster is primarily European. The high number of European countries here might indicate that these nations
 have more in common with each other in terms of higher income levels and SDG progress rates. The presence of Asian countries
 might represent those with comparable economic conditions and development to the European nations in this cluster.

Cluster 4: This cluster is heavily weighted towards African countries, with 25 represented, and has a smaller representation
 from Asia with 7 countries. The dominance of African countries could suggest that this cluster consists of nations with lower
 income scores and SDG progress rates. The presence of some Asian countries implies that there are nations in Asia with 
similar developmental patterns to a substantial portion of Africa.

To answer the research question:

The average "Rate of Progress" on SDGs appears to vary between continents. Asian countries are spread across all clusters, indicating 
a varied rate of progress within the continent. Europe predominantly falls within the higher progress clusters, especially Cluster 3, 
which suggests a generally higher average rate of progress for European countries. African countries are primarily found in clusters 
with a lower rate of progress, indicating a lower average rate of progress for the continent of Africa.

The relationship between income and the rate of progress can be partly inferred from the clustering. European countries, which generally 
have higher income levels, are frequently found in the cluster with a higher rate of progress (Cluster 3). In contrast, African countries
, which are often characterized by lower income levels, dominate the clusters with a lower rate of progress (Clusters 2 and 4). This 
suggests that there is a correlation between higher income and a higher rate of progress among these countries.

These observations can help policymakers and researchers to better understand the link between income levels and SDG progress rates, 
tailoring their strategies to address the unique challenges and strengths within each continent.

Based on the visualization of the boxplot, 

The analysis of the "Rate of Progress" towards sustainable development goals across continents reveals a clear discrepancy influenced 
by economic factors. Median velocity, serving as a proxy for this progress, showcases significant variations that align closely with 
the relative wealth of each continent.

The examination of velocity in relation to income groups further reinforces the connection between economic status and development rate. 
The progression from a median velocity of 58 in low-income countries to 67.5 in high-income countries indicates a positive correlation between
higher income and an increased rate of progress. This relationship suggests that financial strength is pivotal in addressing developmental 
challenges effectively. Higher-income countries have the capacity to invest in health, education, infrastructure, and green technologies—key 
areas underpinning sustainable development.

In sum, the data indicates that economic prosperity is a significant driver of sustainable development progress. While each continent has 
unique circumstances that affect its progress rate, the overall trend suggests that wealthier continents—and within them, wealthier countries—are 
able to make strides more rapidly towards achieving sustainable development goals. This underscores the importance of economic growth and stability 
as foundational elements for advancing global development agendas. 

Above, we created a table that shows the number of countries in different classifications of continents and income group.

```{r}
## Q2 boxplots

full_merged$income_group <- factor(full_merged$income_group, levels=c("Low income", "Lower middle income", "Upper middle income", "High income"))

sdg_income_means <- tibble(
  income_group = c("Low income", "Lower middle income", "Upper middle income", "High income"),
  velocity_mean = c(
    mean(low_income$velocity),
    mean(lower_mid$velocity),
    mean(upper_mid$velocity),
    mean(high_income$velocity)
  )
)
  

ggplot(data = full_merged, aes(y=velocity, x=income_group, fill=income_group))+geom_boxplot() +
 geom_line(data = sdg_income_means,
            aes(x = as.factor(income_group), y = velocity_mean, group = 1), size = 1) +
  labs(title= 'Income group and velocity averages', y= "Velocity", x = "Income Group")

full_merged |> ggplot(aes(y=velocity, x=continent, fill=continent))+geom_boxplot() + labs(title= 'Continent and velocity averages', y= "Velocity", x = " Continent")

```
From the graphs, we can see that there is a positive correlation between higher income and SDG "velocity". The higher the income of a country, the higher the SDG score generally.

We can see that on average, Europe has the highest velocity, followed by Asia, The Americas, and Oceania and Africa with about the same level of velocity.


```{r}
## Q2 scatterplots
full_merged |> ggplot(aes(x= income_score, y=velocity, color=continent)) + geom_point() + labs(title= 'Velocity and income (Individual countries)', y= "Velocity", x = "Income score")

continent_averages |> ggplot(aes(x= average_income_score, y=average_velocity, color=continent)) + geom_point() + labs(title= 'Velocity and income (Continent averages)', y= "Velocity", x = "Income score") + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(55, 70))
```
In the graph above, we compare the Income scores of countries with the velocity. Again, the higher the income score, the higher the velocity. We can see where continents would place on our second graph if we took their average income score and velocity for each country in the continent.



**Q3 Methods** 

```{r}
full_merged <- full_merged %>% 
  mutate(rate_of_progress = velocity / 100) %>% 
  mutate(progress_remaining = 100 - index_score) %>% 
  mutate(time_to_goal = progress_remaining / rate_of_progress)

african <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Africa')
asian <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Asia')
american <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Americas')
oceanian <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Oceania')
european <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Europe')
```

We create a variable of estimated time to goal. With the assumptions that velocity/100 represents the rate of progress of a country on their SDG index score in a year, and that the rate of progress will remain constant. Time to goal represents the estimated time of completion of a country's SDG in years based on our previous assumptions.

Below is the table of the averages of the continent.
```{r}
mean_rate_per_continent <- full_merged %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal))

mean_rate_per_continent

```

```{r}
full_merged |> ggplot(aes(x=time_to_goal, y=index_score, color=continent)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) + geom_point() + labs(x= "Estimated time to SDG completion", y = "Current SDG Index Score", title = "Current SDG Score compared to estimated time to completion") + facet_wrap(~continent)

lm_lines2 <- lm(time_to_goal ~ index_score, data = full_merged)
summary(lm_lines2)$r.squared
```
From the graph, we can see that the higher the current SDG score, the faster it is estimated for the SDG to be completed, as the way we defined the estimated time is based on the current SDG score and how close it is to completion. The current SDG score has a strong negative correlation with Estimated time to SDG completion with an r^2 value of 0.9875944.

From the linear regression lines, we can see that the range of estimated times vary through continents. Europe has a short line that is very high up, they are expected to complete their SDGs relatively fast ranging from the 20s-42.

Meanwhile, Africa, The Americas, Asia and Oceania have a larger range of estimated time to SDG completion, ranging from the 30s all the way up to more than 100 (for Africa).

Next, we'll use bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for estimated time left for SDG completion for each continent at a 95% confidence interval
```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp <- full_merged %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means <- tibble(mean_estimated_time = boot_means)

quantile(boot_means$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
From this, we can say that we are 95% confident that the mean estimated time for countries overall (in the world, not divided into continents) to complete their SDGs are between 49-54 years (using our assumptions used to create the time_to_goal variable).


Next, we'll repeat the tests selecting countries by continent.
```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means_eu <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp_eu <- european %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means_eu[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp_eu |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means_eu <- tibble(mean_estimated_time = boot_means_eu)

quantile(boot_means_eu$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
For European countries 30.65-32.13 years. 

```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means_asia <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp_asia <- asian %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means_asia[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp_asia |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means_asia <- tibble(mean_estimated_time=boot_means_asia)

quantile(boot_means_asia$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
For Asia, it is 48.8-51.5 years


```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means_africa <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp_africa <- african %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means_africa[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp_africa |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means_africa <- tibble(mean_estimated_time=boot_means_africa)

quantile(boot_means_africa$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
For Africa, it is 70.95-75.14 years

```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means_am <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp_am <- american %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means_am[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp_am |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means_am <- tibble(mean_estimated_time=boot_means_am)

quantile(boot_means_am$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
For America, it is 47.4-50.3 years


```{r}
set.seed(10293)

boot_means_oc <- rep(NA, 1000)
for(i in 1:1000)
{
  boot_samp_oc <- oceanian %>% sample_n(size=200, replace=TRUE)
  boot_means_oc[i] <- as.numeric(boot_samp_oc |> summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal)))
}
boot_means_oc <- tibble(mean_estimated_time=boot_means_oc)

quantile(boot_means_oc$mean_estimated_time, c(0.025,0.975))
```
For Oceania, it is 48.5-53.9 years

Altogether, here are the estimated mean time for SDG completion with 95% confidence:
World: 49-54 years
Europe: 30.65-32.13 years 
Africa: 70.95-75.14 years
Asia: 48.8-51.5 years
Oceania: 48.5-53.9 years
America: 47.4-50.3 years

**Q3 visualizations** 
```{r}
#barplot
mean_rate_per_continent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = mean_estimated_time, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black" ) +
  labs(x = "Continent", y = "Estimated Mean Time to Goal (Years)", title = "Estimated Mean Time to SDG Goal by Continent")
```
We can see that on average, Europe has the lowest estimated time to completion of their SDGs.
The Americas, Asia and Oceania has about the same amount of estimated time to completion of their SDGs.
Africa has the highest estimated time to completion of their SDGs.

```{r}
#boxplot
full_merged %>% ggplot( aes(x = time_to_goal)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Time to Goal (Years)", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Estimated Time to SDG Goal") + 
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

We can see that the distributions of time to goals for Europe and Oceania is relatively close to the medians.
Meanwhile for Africa, Americas and Asia, their distribution spread is more varied from the median.

**Conclusions**
In this project, we showcased the relationships between SDG scores, income scores, rate of progress and estimated time left for SDGs, and how different continents differ in terms of those "variables". 

In general, income scores, rate of progress and SDG scores are positively correlated while estimated time left is negatively correlated with rate of progress, and by proxy the other variables as well (although we did not specifically showcase this fact). 

We also showcased on average, Europe has higher income, SDG scores, velocity and are expected to quickly complete their SDGs.
While Africa has the opposite, lower incomes, SDG scores, velocity and are expected to take longer to complete their SDGs.
While Asia, The Americas and Oceania lie somewhere in between the two with more middle income countries and SDG scores, velocities and estimated time in between the two above mentioned continents.
