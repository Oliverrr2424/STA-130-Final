All right summary of the data set objects:
**full_merged** is the total world data with income levels, developing state and SDG scores for their respective countries

**african**, **american**, **asian**, **european** and **oceanian** divides the countries into their respective continents as listed on the *country_codes.csv* file

**high_income**, **upper_mid**, **lower_mid**, **low_income** and **NA_income** divides the countries into their respective income levels as listed on the *sdr_fd5e4b5a.csv* or *goal_file* 
[Note: NA income means that the income level of that country is not listed]

*Stuff still needed*
1: NA values found in SDG index scores
2: NA values found in income levels
3: Understand what Percentage missing values mean

*What to do next:*
1: Decide how to filter the NA values

Analysis

Based on the percentage:
Cluster 1 (Red) - Asia: This cluster has a high concentration of Asian countries, with about 38.78% of 
Asian countries falling into this cluster. This suggests that a significant portion of Asian countries 
share similar SDG progress rates and income levels. The graph suggests this cluster tends to have a lower 
SDG progress rate and a wide range of income scores.

Cluster 2 (Green) - Americas: For Cluster 2, the highest proportion of countries comes from the Americas, 
with roughly 28.57% representation. These countries share similarities in their SDG progress and income levels, 
and looking at the graph, they are generally clustered in the mid-range for both SDG progress rate and income scores.

Cluster 3 (Dark Blue) - Europe: Half of the European countries are represented in Cluster 3. This indicates 
a strong grouping of European countries with similar SDG velocity and higher income levels, as depicted 
by their placement on the graph.

Cluster 4 (Light Blue) - Africa: A significant proportion, of African countries are in Cluster 4. 
This number exceeds 100% due to normalization based on the total number of countries in Africa; it suggests 
that nearly all African countries might be represented in this cluster. These countries, as shown on the graph,
 have a lower SDG progress rate and income scores.

for this one, i do not know why it exceeds.

Based on the counts:
Cluster 1: Asia and Europe are the top two continents, with 19 and 15 countries, respectively. This cluster suggests
 a diverse group of countries from both Asia and Europe that share similar SDG progress and income levels. The relatively 
high count for both continents indicates a mix of possibly developing and emerging economies in Asia alongside several
 European countries that may share economic or developmental similarities with these Asian countries.

Cluster 2: Africa leads this cluster with 12 countries, followed closely by Asia with 11. The closeness in the count
 suggests a balanced representation between African and Asian nations within this cluster. Countries in this cluster
 are likely to have moderate SDG progress rates and income levels, and the presence of both continents indicates similar
 challenges or developmental stages despite geographic diversity.

Cluster 3: Dominated by Europe with 22 countries, and followed by Asia with a significantly smaller representation of 5
 countries, this cluster is primarily European. The high number of European countries here might indicate that these nations
 have more in common with each other in terms of higher income levels and SDG progress rates. The presence of Asian countries
 might represent those with comparable economic conditions and development to the European nations in this cluster.

Cluster 4: This cluster is heavily weighted towards African countries, with 25 represented, and has a smaller representation
 from Asia with 7 countries. The dominance of African countries could suggest that this cluster consists of nations with lower
 income scores and SDG progress rates. The presence of some Asian countries implies that there are nations in Asia with 
similar developmental patterns to a substantial portion of Africa.

This detailed breakdown shows not only the predominant continents in each cluster but also a secondary influence. For instance, 
while Europe dominates Cluster 3, there are also a few Asian countries that have similar characteristics to this mostly European
cluster. Similarly, the Asian presence in Cluster 1 along with Europe suggests some overlap in developmental or economic profiles 
between these regions within the cluster.

It is also interesting to note the significant presence of Asia across all clusters, indicating the continent's diversity in 
terms of development and income levels. Meanwhile, Africa's strong presence in Clusters 2 and 4 could be indicative of common 
development challenges or stages among these countries.

To answer the research question:

The average "Rate of Progress" on SDGs appears to vary between continents. Asian countries are spread across all clusters, indicating 
a varied rate of progress within the continent. Europe predominantly falls within the higher progress clusters, especially Cluster 3, 
which suggests a generally higher average rate of progress for European countries. African countries are primarily found in clusters 
with a lower rate of progress, indicating a lower average rate of progress for the continent of Africa.

The relationship between income and the rate of progress can be partly inferred from the clustering. European countries, which generally 
have higher income levels, are frequently found in the cluster with a higher rate of progress (Cluster 3). In contrast, African countries
, which are often characterized by lower income levels, dominate the clusters with a lower rate of progress (Clusters 2 and 4). This 
suggests that there is a correlation between higher income and a higher rate of progress among these countries.

These observations can help policymakers and researchers to better understand the link between income levels and SDG progress rates, 
tailoring their strategies to address the unique challenges and strengths within each continent.


Based on the visualization of the boxplot, 

The analysis of the "Rate of Progress" towards sustainable development goals across continents reveals a clear discrepancy influenced 
by economic factors. Median velocity, serving as a proxy for this progress, showcases significant variations that align closely with 
the relative wealth of each continent.

Africa, with the lowest median velocity of 59, is indicative of a slower rate of progress. This trend is consistent with the continent's 
broader economic challenges, which may hinder its ability to prioritize and fund sustainable development initiatives effectively. Africa's 
pace suggests that despite potential efforts, the continent's countries may be struggling to match the speed of development seen 
elsewhere, potentially due to infrastructural deficits, governance issues, or external debt burdens that limit available resources for such progress.

In contrast, Europe's median velocity of 68 represents the highest among the continents, signaling an accelerated pace in striving
towards sustainable development goals. Europe's strong performance is likely a reflection of its higher income levels, which correlate 
with the ability to allocate substantial funds and resources towards achieving developmental benchmarks. European countries generally
benefit from robust economic systems, political stability, and advanced technologies, which collectively facilitate progress.

The Americas and Asia, with median velocities of 64 and 64.5, respectively, suggest a moderate rate of progress. The Americas' rate reflects 
the dichotomy within the continent, where advanced economies such as the United States and Canada likely drive much of the progress, balanced 
by slower rates in Central and South American countries. Asia's slightly higher velocity may reflect the rapid development of certain economies 
within the continent, such as China and India, which may elevate the continent's average despite slower progress in other Asian countries.

Oceania's median velocity of 55, the lowest next to Africa, is influenced by the unique challenges faced by many of its island nations. Issues 
like geographic isolation, climate change impact, and limited natural resources could impede the rate of development, despite the presence of
high-income countries like Australia within the continent.

The examination of velocity in relation to income groups further reinforces the connection between economic status and development rate. 
The progression from a median velocity of 58 in low-income countries to 67.5 in high-income countries indicates a positive correlation between
higher income and an increased rate of progress. This relationship suggests that financial strength is pivotal in addressing developmental 
challenges effectively. Higher-income countries have the capacity to invest in health, education, infrastructure, and green technologies—key 
areas underpinning sustainable development.

In sum, the data indicates that economic prosperity is a significant driver of sustainable development progress. While each continent has 
unique circumstances that affect its progress rate, the overall trend suggests that wealthier continents—and within them, wealthier countries—are 
able to make strides more rapidly towards achieving sustainable development goals. This underscores the importance of economic growth and stability 
as foundational elements for advancing global development agendas.
