**Q3 Methods** 

```{r}
full_merged <- full_merged %>% 
  mutate(rate_of_progress = velocity / 100) %>% 
  mutate(progress_remaining = 100 - index_score) %>% 
  mutate(time_to_goal = progress_remaining / rate_of_progress)
```

We create a variable of estimated time to goal. With the assumptions that velocity/100 represents the rate of progress of a country on their SDG index score in a year, and that the rate of progress will remain constant. Time to goal represents the estimated time of completion of a country's SDG in years based on our previous assumptions.

Below is the table of the averages of the continent.
```{r}
mean_rate_per_continent <- full_merged %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(mean_estimated_time = mean(time_to_goal))

mean_rate_per_continent

```
```{r}
african <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Africa')
asian <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Asia')
american <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Americas')
oceanian <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Oceania')
european <- full_merged |> filter(continent == 'Europe')
```

**Q3 visualizations** 
```{r}
#barplot
mean_rate_per_continent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = mean_estimated_time, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black" ) +
  labs(x = "Continent", y = "Estimated Mean Time to Goal (Years)", title = "Estimated Mean Time to SDG Goal by Continent")
```
We can see that on average, Europe has the lowest estimated time to completion of their SDGs.
The Americas, Asia and Oceania has about the same amount of estimated time to completion of their SDGs.
Africa has the highest estimated time to completion of their SDGs.

```{r}
#boxplot
full_merged %>% ggplot( aes(x = time_to_goal)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Time to Goal (Years)", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Estimated Time to SDG Goal") + 
  facet_wrap(~continent)
```

We can see that the distributions of time to goals for Europe and Oceania is relatively close to the medians.
Meanwhile for Africa, Americas and Asia, their distribution spread is more varied from the median.
